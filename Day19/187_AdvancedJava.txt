1 What is Maven?
	- Maven is Project Management tool 
	- It is project Management Tool
		- It is Build Tool
		- add required jars & their dependencies in project classpath & deployment assembly
		- compilation of the project.
		- testing & packaing project deployment assembly.
		- Reporting
	- Meaning of Maven is "Accumulator of knowledge". 
		-Maven is in yiddish language word.
		
	- Maven is automation & management tool developed by Apache s/w foundation. It is based on POM (project Object Model)=> config of project
		- basic Config : java version, spring version,maven version etc...
		- dependencies: third party jar files to be added in project.
		- packaging info: jar or war, name, groupId/artifactId
		- build settings.
		- repositories: collection of jars.
		
	- Maven can build project into desired output such as .jar, .war etc
	- It is mostly used for java based project.
	- Maven is written in java.
	
	Java Project Structure
	- Source code => Developer Purpose 
	- Test code => Tester purpose 
	- resource (assets,files,directories)
	- dependances/Library
	- Configuration
	- Task Runner (build,test,Run)
	- Reporting

3 Create Maven Project
4 What is Spring?
	framework-
  1 framework is a set of API-Application programming interface(It's predefined classes & interface) which works predefined algorithms & targetated to specific domain
  2 to develop the application in the systematic format/Structred format with the help of framework
  e.g in photo studio shop 
  3 Spring is framework of framework i.e combination of framework (means it work all functionality of core java standalone application,web application,data structure as collection framework).
  4 It has fix Flow it already predefined e.g. bus route is fix from katraj to swarget & swarget to katraj

Spring Framework:
	- Pre-requisits: OOP concepts & coding,core java,Introductory knowlegdge of Advanced Java.
	- Spring is light-weight comprehensive framework to Simplify Java (SE+EE) Development.
	- Light-weight -- Framework size is small + minimal num of jars (for give req.) + Minimal overheads.
		- Comprehensive -- Provides lot of functionality in minimal code.
		- Simplify Java Development -- Developer can focus on business logic, Spring manage testing, integration of other libs, ...
		- Depedency Injection
		
- Spring Framework:
		- 2003 -- Rod Johnson -- sourceforge.net -- Open Source project.
		- Spring 1.x.x
		- Spring 2.x
		- * Spring 3.x -- Annotation based config.
		- * Spring 4.x => 4.x.x
		- Spring 5.x
		- Spring 6.x
5 Spring Features/ Advantages 
		- Modular -- different jars for different functionalities.
		- Flexible -- Most of frameworks follow "All or nothing" policy -- Spring is exception
		- Test Driven Development -- Unit testing is well integrated in Spring + Support for other testing.
		- Maintainable/Extendable -- Start with interfaces & can change impl over the time.
		- Exceptions -- Spring convert/wraps all checked exception into unchecked one.
		- Depedency Injection
