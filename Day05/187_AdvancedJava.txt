5 Http Request & HTTP Response
		
	Http Request => http header + http body 
     1 http header
			- ip address 
			- server ip address 
			- method name 
			- date & time 
			- auth token 
			- content Type 
				- image 
				- file 
				- pdf 
				- json 
				- video 
				- audio
				
	2 	 http body  
				data 
					- json 
					- text/html 
					- xml => outdatated
