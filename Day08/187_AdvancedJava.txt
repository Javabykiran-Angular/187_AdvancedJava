1 Send Response of Html format
	PrintWriter pw= response.getWriter();
	pw.print("...")
	pw.write("...")
	
	pw.write("<html><head>...</head><body><h2>...</h2>")
	
2 Servlet collabration
	it navigate from one servlet to another servlet/html  
3 Request Dispatcher
	
	1 Forward(request,response)
	
	ReqestDispatcher rd= request.getDispatcher("DashboradServlet");
	rd.Forward(request,response);
		
	
	2 include(request,response)
		u can add any message and navigate
		pw.write("<h2>Invalid User</h2>")
		ReqestDispatcher rd= request.getDispatcher("login.html");
		request.contentType("text/html");
		rd.include(request,response);
4 response.sendRedfirect("DashboradServlet");

Today's Lecture Agenda
1 Jsp Introduction
 - It is A front End Technology
 - It is Java Specific platform 
  JSP are out-dated -- still used in old applications.
	- JSP only Support 3 methods
		1 GET 2 POST 3 HEAD
	- JSP = Presentation Logic* + Business Logic
	- JSP is front-end technology i.e. web ui.
* JSP is converted into the servlet during execution.
	- JSP page -- .jsp
	- It Contain HTML tags + JSP tags + Custom tags + Java code
	* Writing/Embedding Java code in JSP pages is "worst" practice.
	* Best practice is to use "Java Beans" with JSP pages for BL. 	
JSP Tags
	JSP Syntax:
    - Contains markup: HTML tags, JSP tags, Custom tags.
	- Server side code (Java) -- will be executed on server -- not sent to client.
	-  some basic tags as follow
	  a. Directive: Defines behaviour of JSP (generated servlet).
		- It define structure of page
		
		import java.lang.util.*
		
			- <%@ page ... %> - Page Directive			
			   - In page directive you can use various attribute to give more info about the page like
			     1 language="java"
				 2 contentType="text/html"
				 3 import="packagename.classname" here you can import one or more package at a time only use comma seperatated
				 4 isErrorPage="true"
				 
			- <%@ include ... %>			
			   1 If we have to add some static content in our page we use include directive
			   2 Basically we add an HTML content because it is static
			   3 Generally we use Header,footer, nav bar or any Other universal content etc.
			   
			- <%@ taglib ... %> - JSP Custom Lib 
			   1 Declares a tag library, containing custom actions, used in the page
			  
		b. Declaration: 
		    - Java code (fields/methods) to be added in generated servlet.
			-  you will most often find declaration tags working in combination with expression or scriptlet tags
			- It is used generally declare variable & methods(Signature(retrun type ,name ,parameter ) + Defination)
			- Syntax  <%! int a=10; // Forward Declaration & Defination 
					public void test(){
					......
					}
				
			%>
			- In declaration tag after every statement we required to use ';'
		c. Scriptlet: 
			- Java code to be executed per request i.e. to be added in service() method.
			- If variable declare its scope in jsp service method
			- To write a Business logic/Call BL
			- Syntax <% a++; %>
			- In scriptlet tag after every statement we required to use ';'
		d. Expression
			- Java expression (that evaluates to some value) whose result is added in generated response (writer).
			- To excute an expression or to simply print actual value.
			- Syntax  <%=a  %>
			- In expression tag don't use ';'
		e. Comment
			- Server side comment, which is discarded during processing and not visible to client.
			- If you want use jsp comment you can use it.
			- <%-- ... --%>
			
2 Implicit Object
JSP Implicit objects:
	- Local variables of jspService() methods & hence directly accessible in request handling stage i.e. scriptlets & expressions.
	- When JSP Page gets compiled it gets translated into corresponding sevlet at that time it creates few objects they are known as implicit object of JSP
	- request: HttpServletRequest (Main)
	- response: HttpServletResponse (Main)
	- session: HttpSession (Main)
	- config: ServletConfig
	- application: ServletContext
	- out: JspWriter (PrintWriter) (Main)
	- page: Object (this pointer)
	- pageContext: PageContext (state management in JSP) - This encapsulates use of server-specific features like higher performance JspWriters.
	- exception: Throwable -- only for custom error pages - JSP.
		<%@ page isErrorPage="true" %> (Main)
